# Useful-Scripts

This is repository with my useful everyday `.sh` scripts, maybe you will need any of them.
List:
- zig-minimal.sh: Basically `zig init` but it's a small "hello world" project.
    `zig-minimal.sh [project_name]` - project_name is optional.
- vtube.sh: just script to start OpenSeeFace, basically just shortcut. If you want to use it - place OpenSeeFace in your $HOME dir. (i used [THIS](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Running-VTS-on-Linux/) to setup it for myself)
